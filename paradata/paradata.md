Macro Paradata: the big decisions relating to the nature of the visualisation.



    Why has the resource being created and for what audience? _(SG says: interpret this as asking you to tie your work into the big themes, issues, from this course)_
    
The 3D model was built as a attempt to recreate a valuable object into a 3-Dimensional copy on a computer. The objective for making this model is to be able to digitally reproduce an object or artifact, making it exist as a completely new piece, and separately from the original object. Reproducing an object digitally enables a person to preserve that object without having the (physical) object itself, making it insignificant to the time and space of the original object. The model is a digintal copy of the object at a specific moment in time, taking into account all the changes that occured to the object up until that moment. Walter Benjamin stated in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction": "Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be" (Benjamin, 1935). Finally, the model is about bringing the object to a different format, fromt the physical format to the digital format.

    How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and accessible? _(SG says: interpret this to reflect on the technologies you've used)_

The technological tools I've used in the process of making the model are the andriod application "SCANN3D", and computer programs such as " 3DF Zephyr", "Gimp", "SketchUp", "Mixed Reality Viewer" and "Paint 3D". 

    Why have you chosen to use the approach/methods applied? _(SG says intrpret this to reflect on your actual process - what worked, what didn't, given the kinds of guidance or advice you've been able to find?)_

I used the mobile application "SCANN3D" as it is the recommended 3D scanning application for android phones. I decided to use my bookend as the scanned object after a failed attempt at using artifacts from the museum of science and technology as a model. All of their artifacts were surrounded by glass barriers, which are reflective and transparent, two characteristics that the application advised to avoid. During the guided scanning, I encountered certain issues that caused me to restart the process several times. The most recurring issue was "low object certainty", and the other issue was the realization that the background must be as plain as possible for a good model (finding a plain background with adequate lighting was the issue). After transfterring the model on my computer, I got stuck with the program "Paint 3D" as I could not find the right folder for the imported texture (the colors of the model), I ended up finding out which folder was the right one, it was the one that contained the .mtl file, the .obj file and the .jpg file of the model. 



Micro Paradata: the small-scale decision-making processes underlying the construction of the visualisation.



    What are the basic steps you followed in putting together the resource?
    
To create the 3D model, I used the android application called "SCANN3D" which allows me to take a large number of app-guided pictures around the object and build a virtual 3-Dimensional copy of the object from those pictures on the application. I downloaded the model as an .obj file on my phone, connected my phone to my computer and transfered the model to my desktop. From there I tried to open it with different programs such as 3D Builder, 3DF Zephyr, Paint 3D, Gimp and SketchUp. I successfully opened the full model on Paint 3D but the program didn't allow me to crop or cut of the extra background that was left on the model.

    What supporting evidence did you rely upon?
    
I relied upon the guidance of the 3D scanning applicaiton to build the model, going back to their "tips and best practices" to see what I was doing wrong durign the 3D scanning.
